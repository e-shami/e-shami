- 👋 Hi, I’m @e-shami aka Ehtisham Rehmat
- 👀 I’m interested in back-end development and data structures and algorithms for quite a while now. I have also been doing paid projects for these two feilds for more than 3 years.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development using MERN stack, though I am very interested in also learning new technologies as well,
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on team or group projects for both learning and paid purposes. I also look forward to share my knowledge here on Github that I have worked over the years.
- 📫 How to reach me through my email and my Fiverr account(in case you are interested in paid projects), which are as follow:
-     - Email: 
            - shamid3vs@gmail.com
